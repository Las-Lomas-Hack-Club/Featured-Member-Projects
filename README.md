# Featured-Member-Projects
Here are some of our members awesome projects that were created in Las Lomas Hack Club!  For each meeting we will have one winner.  THe projects are due the day before the next meeting to be featured, but you can work on one project for as long as you want before submitting it.  There may be extra stickers as prizes, but other than that there will be no monetary prizes.  Can't wait to see what you guys make!  Happy coding.
