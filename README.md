# Featured-Member-Projects
Here are some of our members awesome projects that were created in Las Lomas Hack Club!  For each meeting we will have one winner.  THe projects are due the day before the next meeting to be featured, but you can work on one project for as long as you want before submitting it.  There may be extra stickers as prizes or shirts as prizes, but no money will be awarded to winners.  Can't wait to see what you guys make!  Happy coding.
